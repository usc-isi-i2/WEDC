| Problems and Solution
+----------------------------------------
1) post doesnâ€™t contain any seed words

post id: 30 36 37 74 251 252 291 314 321 374 375 377 423
total invalid: 24981/50000

example:
sexi addict alway readi fun sweet clean independ discreet nice bodi sparkl person total packag even beauti person look forward meet real

words in post       seeds
sexy                bombshellsexi naughtysexi sexi sexii
readi               princessreadi readili
sweet               youngsweet
clean               cleanup
bodi                fullbodi
person              bellperson
beauti              beautiful skinbeauti
look                naturallook
real                realest realpic realupsc

note: post contains a lot of abbreviated words, such as RealPics

solution: 
update the implementation for post2vec
if the word in post matches substring of the seed, then we treat they are match

2) many duplicate samples

solution: use hashlib, by which reduce sample size from 500000 to 20043

3) seed words contain nick name (unsolved)

post extraction contain person's nick name, like "lili" or "yoyo".
The form changes, and useful dict is required to remove them

4) seed words contain meaningless word (unsolved)

test data source contain lots of meaningless words, and these words would be selected as similar words of seed word.

e.g. a) selected as features for post
our program extracts word "availableyou", which is the from the sentence of original source: "Please note: fresh clean towels, in a fresh and clean setting is always availableyou will leave feeling refreshed and rejuvenated. <br />"

e.g. b) post id 23849

our program extracts word "thesuccessfulcandidateisanentrepreneurialexecutivewhoisabletodemonstrateasolidtrackrecordofsuccessofprofitablygrowingamarketdrivenintern"

original post content: not selected as feature word, but meaningless

5) isolated node in knn graph

some nodes cannot be annotated by our program if they are far away from seed words, and there are no any nodes that similar to seed words could arrive

solution: adjust number of nearest neigobors for knn graph.
