I AM OUT OF TOWN FOR AN UNDETERMINED AMOUNT OF TIME 
<BR />
<BR />Again & again the guys at our parties say:
<BR />
<BR />"You give one of the BEST performances weve ever seen. You're everything you say you are and MORE!"
<BR />
<BR />Our strippers are beautiful, healthy, intelligent, reliable, honest, talented and friendly. They have GREAT attitudes and put on a phenomenal performance!
<BR />
<BR />
<BR />And SERIOUSLY, when you hire an exotic dancer, there are 10 things she should be able to do:<BR />
<BR />
<BR />1. SHOW UP ~ hard to believe that that "no shows" without communication even, are common in the industry
<BR />2. ARRIVE ON TIME
<BR />3. Be PROFESSIONAL ~ answers her phone, returns your calls, provides lots of info, knows what she's doing, runs a tight show
<BR />4. Be ATTRACTIVE ~ HOT & SEXY 
<BR />5. Be WILD & FUN & UNINHIBITED<BR />6. Be WARM, FRIENDLY & INTERACTIVE and have A GREAT ATTITUDE
<BR />7. Be the PERSON IN THE PICS SHE SHOWS YOU!
<BR />8. Be COMFORTABLE and RELAXED and do an AWESOME SHOW with lighting, music and tons of props, toys and games!
<BR />9. Stay for HOURS and HOURS if she doesnt have other commitments and the crowd is participating and being respectful.  
<BR />10. Show you things you've never seen before and make your night UNFORGETTABLE!
<BR />
<BR />Exotic Magic Strippers will COME THROUGH on ALL 10 of these things!
<BR />
<BR />We do games with whipped cream, oil, lollipops, beads, toys, cherries & flips and tricks like feed the kitty, buried treasure, body to body massage, S&%K & F$@K (a game), slip and slide, ring toss and so much more!
<BR />
<BR />PRIVATE ONE-ON-ONE SHOWS TOO!
<BR />
<BR />SENSUAL MASSAGES AVAILABLE TOO!
