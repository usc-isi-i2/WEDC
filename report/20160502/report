| Problems and Solution
+----------------------------------------
1) post doesnâ€™t contain any seed words

post id: 30 36 37 74 251 252 291 314 321 374 375 377 423
total invalid: 24981/50000

example:
sexi addict alway readi fun sweet clean independ discreet nice bodi sparkl person total packag even beauti person look forward meet real

words in post       seeds
sexy                bombshellsexi naughtysexi sexi sexii
readi               princessreadi readili
sweet               youngsweet
clean               cleanup
bodi                fullbodi
person              bellperson
beauti              beautiful skinbeauti
look                naturallook
real                realest realpic realupsc

note: post contains a lot of abbreviated words, such as RealPics

solution: 
update the implementation for post2vec
if the word in post matches substring of the seed, then we treat they are match

2) many duplicate samples

solution: use hashlib, by which reduce sample size from 500000 to 20043

3) seed words contain nick name (unsolved)

post extraction contain person's nick name, like "lili" or "yoyo".
The form changes, and useful dict is required to remove them

4) seed words contain meaningless word (unsolved)

test data source contain lots of meaningless words, and these words would be selected as similar words of seed word.

e.g. a) selected as features for post
our program extracts word "availableyou", which is the from the sentence of original source: "Please note: fresh clean towels, in a fresh and clean setting is always availableyou will leave feeling refreshed and rejuvenated. <br />"

e.g. b) post id 23849

our program extracts word "thesuccessfulcandidateisanentrepreneurialexecutivewhoisabletodemonstrateasolidtrackrecordofsuccessofprofitablygrowingamarketdrivenintern"

original post content: not selected as feature word, but meaningless

5) isolated node in knn graph

some nodes cannot be annotated by our program if they are far away from seed words, and there are no any nodes that similar to seed words could arrive

solution: adjust number of nearest neigobors for knn graph.


6) punctuation problem

e.g. a) additional punctuations
original post content:
Shes an ANGEL**Beautiful* Natural* GINGER - 22 

post content after preprocessing:
shes 

note: replace `*` to ` ` first is not the best solution, since there are other posts the contain information like "A*N*G*E*L"

e.g. b) missing '''

I'm -> Im, in original post


7) post contain few information

e.g. a) post id 44472

original post content:
Lola Baby - 21. 

post content after preprocessing:
babi 

e.g. b) post id 10802

original post content:
Call now<br>
Tiffany<br>
<br>
415 846 733six 

post content after preprocessing:
call

| Result
+----------------------------------------

20028 samples

previously annotated:
515 smaples for others(1)
14 samples for massage(2)
27 samples for escort(3)
12 samples for job_ads(4)

#############################
# Example One
#############################

# first step

label propagation algorithm returns 1880 annoated samples for massage

# second step
mannually annotate typical error result to correct one

e.g. post id 65
it actually belongs to job_ads, but annotated as massage by LP algorithm.

modify these error results and retrain LP algorithm.

# third step

label propagation algorithm returns 1815 annoated samples for massage

post id 65 can be correctly annotated as job_ads, and its neighbors, post id 66 and 5547, also can be annotated as job_ads

It's a post similar to massage, but belongs to escort actually 


249 is the neighbors of post 3938, 4104, 4179...
By adjusting the result of post 249's related posts, post 249 can be correctly annotated as escort



+----------------------------------------
| Conclusion and Next Step
+----------------------------------------
Our solution relies on outlier&pre-annotated samples for label propagation algorithm

if we have few outlier&pre-annotated samples:
LB algorithm get lots of unknown result(algorithm cannot predict which category a post should belongs to)
cannot handle escort and massage posts


To get outlier&pre-annotated samples, we need:
1. continue run LA algorithm
2. manually annotate correct label for error results
3. collect ambiguous samples with manually annotated correct labels, and use then to conduct next try
4. converged when result looks good
