Before running label propagation, we have to manually annotate some posts, and the amount of samples I annotated for each categories is shown below.

job_ads: 9
massage: 1
escort: 10
others: 2

After the label propagation algorithm converged, I manually organize the result that has been shown below.

isolate nodes:  21

            precision           recall
1: job_ads      31/39 (79.48%)      31/44 (70.45%)
2: massage  1
3: escort       35/35 (100%)        35/52 (67.31%)
4: others       2
